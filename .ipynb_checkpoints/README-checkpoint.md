To Know more about this benchmarking framework please go through the following papers :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03137)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Optimization Applications as Quantum Performance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02278)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Quantum Algorithm Exploration using Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08985)

All the algorithms in the framework are benchmarked in **qiskit**, **cirq**, **bracket** environments.

Instructions for setting up the repository and further information regarding the benchmarks are already provided in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[this Repository](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks)

In this repository we have changed the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[QC-Application-Oriented-Benchmark-Suite](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks) framework and made it into a single **.ipynb** file (for each algorithm) so that there will be no need dependencies.

All the algorithms of Benchmarking Suite are categorized into three types **Tutorial**, **Sub-routine** and **Functional**. So the same flow is maintained in this repository.

```text
The status of every algorithm in each category will be maintained in their corresponding directory.
